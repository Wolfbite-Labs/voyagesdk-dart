This is the Dart SDK for Packbase and other *base projects. This SDK is used by Packbase itself, so
everything that Packbase can do, you can do as well.

This can be used for any scope of project, including but not limited to;

- Third-party Packbase clients
- Bots (user interactions, cron jobs, specific auto mods, etc.)

> [!CAUTION]
> This SDK is still in development and is not yet ready for production use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **VoyageSDK requires a language version of at least 3.5.**  
> There are [minor breaking changes](https://medium.com/dartlang/dart-3-5-6ca36259fa2f) between 3.4 and 3.5, so keep that in mind if 
> you choose to migrate an existing Dart application for the purpose of adding VoyageSDK functionality.
